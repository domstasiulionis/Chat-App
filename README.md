## :receipt: About
This is a simple chat applicaiton that I had built to apply what I have recently been learning about NodeJS and ExpressJS. I also took this opportunity to expand on that knowledge by learning about web sockets, which were an important aspect of this project. Users can join create and join a room, where they are able to message each other in real-time thanks to the power of web sockets.

## :hammer: Built Using:
* [React](https://reactjs.org/) - Front-end library
* [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) - Styling
* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) - Back-end
* [ExpressJS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) - Back-end framework
* [Socketio](https://socket.io/) - Web socket library 
* [react-scroll-to-bottom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-scroll-to-bottom/) - React component for automatic scrolling to bottom
* [React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/) - Icons
